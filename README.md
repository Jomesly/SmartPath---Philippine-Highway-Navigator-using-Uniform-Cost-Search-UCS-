The algorithm is suitable to the Philippine environment since the algorithm strikes the balance between the costs of the tolls, traffic conditions and number of available routes to use so that the travelers make a convenient decision. It depicts real life accuracy with real highway data: NLEX, SLEX and CALAX and it takes into consideration traffic congestion and long-haul inter-provinces travels within Metro Manila. Having a time complexity of O((V + E) log V), and space complexity of O(V), it is a fast algorithm to use under mobile or GPS apps. crucially, it is culturally relevant to Filipino travel behaviour, giving preference to the economic efficiencies of weighing expensive but quick expressways against the free albeit slower national road network. All in all, it offers optimised driving based on the peculiar issues that exist in driving in the Philippines.
